# 👋 Hi, I’m Brett

I’m a Software Development Engineer in Test with a strong background in automation, QA strategy, and building scalable testing frameworks. I focus on improving test coverage, reliability, and CI driven quality across web, mobile, and API platforms.

Most of my work centers around designing automation frameworks from the ground up and integrating them into CI pipelines to reduce risk in fast moving development environments.

## 🧪 What I Work On

This GitHub contains projects that reflect how I approach quality engineering, not just test execution.

You’ll find examples of:
- End to end automation for web and mobile applications
- API test frameworks and mock services
- CI pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- Python based automation frameworks
- Embedded and service level testing concepts
- Tools built to improve test reliability and visibility

## 🚀 How I Think About QA

I believe good QA is proactive, not reactive. I focus on building testing systems teams can trust, integrating automation early, and making failures easy to understand and act on.

I enjoy owning QA strategy, collaborating closely with developers, and continuously improving how quality is built into the development process.
